- Get some simple Assets start working on animations
- Might have to create own asset

--  fix issue where if you hit a wall and you try to jump:
    lifts you up a bit so you're considered ungrounded.
    seems to be a controller issue weird

- Separate player inputs into a separate script
- Fix the jump on slope, right now on slopes there's a bit of angle added, need to zero out if on slope.
- Fix dash logic, we are no longer using gravity
